   <h1>Story of LeBron James</h1>
   <p>LeBron James was born in Akron, OH on December 30, 1984. His father wasn't present in his life and his early
    years were very hard for him, however, his basketball coach played a significant role in his life by letting Lebron 
    stay with his family so that he could work on school and basketball. Soon Lebron became a legend at his highschool, averaging 20
    points a game during his freshman year, and quickly rose up to the eyes of the NBA. Lebron absolutely carried his highschool team to two consecutive 
    division 3 state champonships, so it was no surprise that Lebron skipped college and joined the NBA as the first overall pick by the Cleveland Cavaliers.
    To this day Lebron still plays in the NBA, going into his 23rd year, and has played for 3 different teams. His impact on the game of basketball has been
   massive. He's considered the best player of all time by many and is the leading all-time scorer in the NBA.</p>
